greetings, these are my MAS submods :)

Before you download: These mods may remove or lock certain topics in the MAS code.
If you wan't these topics back, a reinstall of the Mod won't work! You will need to create a submod yourself, that re-unlocks these topics.

If you don't care, because you want these topics gone in the first place, proceed to the downloads.
Thanks for using my submods and I hope you enjoy these!

If you want to use my submods as a base then feel free to, but please credit me if you want to make them public.
